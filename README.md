# DogiChain


## What is DogiChain ?

DogiChain is a Java project that helps me understand blockchain technology even better. Our Block class contains a string hash that will hold our digital signature. The variable previousHash to hold the previous blockâ€™s hash and string data to hold our block data. There are many cryptographic algorithms you can choose from, but I choosed **SHA-256** for this project.

Each block now has its own digital signature based on its information and the signature of the previous block.
